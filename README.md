# Super-rentals

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.
A short introduction of this app could easily go here.

Property Rental Application
Follow along with the weekend homework to create a property rental application. This is an application where property owners may list places for rent, and renters will be able to find places to stay. (Similar to AirBnB, or Vacasa ). As you build your application, refer back to the map you created during the warmup exercise as necessary.

To begin, create three basic, static pages that do not require model data:

Home
About
Contact
Next, take your time to work through the following:

Determine the properties that each rental should have. Add a list of rentals and their properties to the home page where users can see them when they land on the home page. (Use data hard-coded in the route handler to begin.)
Set up a Firebase app to serve as your backend data storage. Upload your rental data in json format.
Create an Ember Data model for rentals.
Allow users to click a button to see an image of each rental.
Let users click the image to hide it again.
Give users the ability to delete rentals from the list.
Add a "New Rental" button to allow users to add their rentals to the list.
Further Exploration
Create a new model called Announcement that will allow the site administrator to add important messages for users (upcoming sales, weather warnings, and other big exciting news).
Allow administrators to add and delete announcements. (We are not adding user authentication, so technically the admins and users can see the same information, that's fine for now!)
Add a button or link on the main page for users to visit these "Important announcements".
